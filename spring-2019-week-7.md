# Week 7

- This week students learned how to create and use machine learning models using Amazon Web Services.
- Three different machine learning models were created and tested:
- Binary classification – A training set of 50,000 fictitious bank customer marketing records were used to determine whether or not a prospective customer would purchase a specific service from the bank. The data set contained 50 columns of information about prior customers who bought services from the bank in the past. The prediction model created had a 75% prediction accuracy rate.
- Multiclass classification – A training set of 40,000 records that contained cartographic information about forestation coverage was used to train an AI model. The model generated showed 7 different types of predicted tree coverage along with the confidence of each forestation type prediction.
- Regression analysis – A training set of 40,000 records that contained historic housing price information was used to train a machine learning model. The training data contained 76 columns of data and created predictions that were 80% accurate.
- Students then learned how to with just a few lines of Python code, send data records to any of the three models that were created to have them predicted programmatically.
- Students were introduced to TensorFlow and how to use it with the Keras Python library to create machine learning image processing models.
- Week 8 will be dedicated to coding image recognition machine learning models using Python.
- Week 9 will be dedicated to connecting the Cozmo robot with the image recognition machine learning code that was developed during Week 8.
- I continue to shape this class to my teaching style and technical knowledge.
- Students are continuing to have fun and they are learning a lot.
