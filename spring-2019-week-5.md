# Week 5

- Enrollment remains at 14.
- This week was all about integrating the Anki Cozmo Robot with commercial AI image recognition services.
- Students learned about Amazon S3 file storage services and how to access them from Python.
- Students learned how to use Cozmoâ€™s camera and image recognition capabilities and access them from Python.
- Students learned how to use and develop programs using Amazons AWS Rekognition image analysis service.
- Students learned how to process and read the image analysis data returned from the image recognition service.
- Students developed a pet detection Python program that would have Cozmo cruise around a room looking for pets. Once it finds a pet, it snaps a picture of it, saves it, sends it to Amazon S3 file storage and then sends the URL of the image to the AI recognition service for processing and identification.
- In Week 6 we will begin the use of Anaconda which is a free and open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing (data science, machine learning applications, large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, etc.), that aims to simplify package management and deployment (from Wikipedia).
- I continue to shape this class to my teaching style and technical knowledge.
- Students are continuing to have fun and they are learning a lot.
