# Week 4

- Enrollment is now at 14. We had one student drop off the roster due to lack of tuition payment.
- This week was all about programming the Anki Cozmo Robot with Python.
- On Tuesday students watched a 45-minute demo of how Python and Cozmo work together that I put together.
- On Tuesday students went through all of the Python Software Development Kit Cozmo Tutorials [http://cozmosdk.anki.com/docs/downloads.html?_ga=2.213723350.31827429.1556897347-1784657735.1554354157](http://cozmosdk.anki.com/docs/downloads.html?_ga=2.213723350.31827429.1556897347-1784657735.1554354157)
- On Thursday students were asked to create a Python program that directed Cozmo to perform an 8 step operation. The use of the robots drive mechanisms, vision system, and facial and sound animations were used.
- In Week 5 we will begin to incorporate AI into the use of the robot to identify pets and then have the Cozmo take a picture and upload it to the Amazon cloud.
- We will also be exploring how to integrate the Cozmo with services such as Twitter, Amazon Rekognition (an image recognition service provided by Amazon), and also IBM’s Watson.
- The company that makes the Anki robots announced that they are closing down [https://www.vox.com/2019/4/29/18522966/anki-robot-cozmo-staff-layoffs-robotics-toys-boris-sofman](https://www.vox.com/2019/4/29/18522966/anki-robot-cozmo-staff-layoffs-robotics-toys-boris-sofman)
- With just one week of Python training, students are exceeding my expectations with their ability to program the Cozmo robot.
- Some of the issues we ran into during the week were trying to get Android smartphones to work with Cozmo. With the help of one of the students in the class we resolved all of them.
- The issues we had with 3D Printing have been resolved using what are called “helper disks” which get placed by the MakerBot software. With this progress, I continue to print student designs.
- I continue to shape this class to my teaching style and technical knowledge.
- Students are continuing to have fun and they are learning a lot.
