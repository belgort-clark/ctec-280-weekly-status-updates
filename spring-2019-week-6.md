# Week 6

- Enrollment remains at 14.
- This week students were introduced to Anaconda which is a free and open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing (data science, machine learning applications, large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, etc.), that aims to simplify package management and deployment (from Wikipedia).
- Students used Python to learn about data series and data frames using the NumPy and Pandas Python libraries.
- Students learned all about Jupyter Notebooks and why they are part of a data scientist and machine learning professionals toolbox.
- Students learned how to programmatically cleanse data by looking for missing data using NumPy and Pandas.
- Students learned how to import data from comma separated value (CSV) files and use then use the data for analysis using Pandas.
- Students learned how to then use the MathPlotLib and Seaborn Python libraries to plot and chart data series and data frames.
- Students learned how to customize charts and graphs using Python (tick marks, line styles and thicknesses, axes and more)
- Student then learned how to export the charts as jpgâ€™s to be used in other work that they do.
- Students learned how to share Jupyter Notebook files with one another.
- Next week we will dig more into data science by exploring some machine learning techniques with Jupyter Notebook.
- We will also be exploring more image recognition techniques as they will be needed for the students final projects.
- I continue to shape this class to my teaching style and technical knowledge.
- Students are continuing to have fun and they are learning a lot.
