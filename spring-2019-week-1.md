# Week 1

- We have 3 parent/student groups who are now enrolled in the course
- We have one faculty member who is auditing the class
- We will have a total of 15 students in the class as of next week
- I have setup, configured and printed on one of the 3D Printers. Itâ€™s currently in my office
- I have setup and configured the NAO robot
- I have contact IT to get a private wireless network setup in SHL 125
- We covered the history of robotics and ethics this week. Both classes were full of meaningful and lively discussions.
- I have modified some of the material in week 1 to be more in line with my teaching style and the student population
- I have modified the weekly schedule. 3D Printing was in Week 9/10 in the Bellevue model. I thought it would be a good week 2 topic rather than statistics. I then moved Python programming which only 28% of the class has had prior experience with.
