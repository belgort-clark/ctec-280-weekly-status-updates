# Week 8

- This week students learned how **Convolution Neural Networks (CNN)** can be used for image recognition. We also reviewed how they work under the hood. Having a second deep dive discussion about this helped the class better understand how complex CNNâ€™s actually are.
- The complex machine learning software stack has proven to be a challenge for students using their own laptops. 64 bit Python is required in order to use TensorFlow. Most students were using 32 bit Python. Additionally, all of the libraries that they used throughout the course had to be uninstalled and reinstalled for 64 bit.
- Students used the Cozmo robots to take 3000 pictures of various army men and dinosaur figures. 150 pictures were captures in 10 second increments as students moved the Cozmo around them.
- Once all of the images were captured, they began running the Python code provided to generate the machine learning model.
- The model building will take 5-12 hours depending on the students computer.
- Week 9 will be dedicated to connecting the Cozmo robot with the image recognition machine learning code that was developed during Week 8.
- Students will then program the Cozmo to cruise around and look for the figurine of their choice. The army man or the dinasour. Once it's identified it will then be programmed to accelerate towards it and knock it over.
